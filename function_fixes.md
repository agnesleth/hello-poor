# Firebase Function Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **OpenAI API Key Not Found**: The function couldn't find the OpenAI API key in environment variables
2. **No Matching Stores Found**: The function wasn't finding any stores with articles on sale
3. **No Recipes Generated**: Even with recipes in the database, no recommendations were being generated

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Environment Variables for OpenAI API Key

- Added proper environment variable handling using multiple sources
- Set up `.env` file for local development
- Created `.runtimeconfig.json` for local testing
- Added a deployment script to configure Firebase environment

### 2. Store Data Handling

- Added detailed logging to diagnose store data issues
- Added checks to print all available stores
- Implemented a fallback to sample data if no articles are found
- Created instructions to add test data to Firestore

### 3. Recipe Generation Improvements

- Added fallback to default preferences if user preferences don't yield results
- Added more detailed logging for debugging
- Added validation checks for empty results

### 4. CORS Support

- Enabled CORS for the function to allow browser access

## New Files Created

1. `/functions/.env` - Environment variables for local development
2. `/functions/.runtimeconfig.json` - Config for Firebase Functions local emulator
3. `/functions/deploy.sh` - Script to deploy function with proper environment variables
4. `/hello-poor/setup_data.md` - Instructions for setting up test data in Firestore

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the Updated Function**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/buyn/Desktop/agnes_och_axel/functions
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

2. **Add Test Data to Firestore**:
   Follow the instructions in `setup_data.md` to add store and recipe data

3. **Test the Application**:
   Run the Next.js app and try generating recipes again

4. **Monitor Logs**:
   Check Firebase Functions logs for any new errors or warnings

With these changes, your function should now be able to:
- Successfully retrieve the OpenAI API key
- Use sample data if no stores are found
- Generate recommendations even with limited user preferences
- Provide detailed logging for debugging

If you continue to experience issues, the additional logging will help identify the specific problem.
